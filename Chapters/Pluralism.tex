\section{Moral commitments}

In this chapter I will set out and defend several basic commitments.
They can be briefly summarized as follows:

\begin{align}
  \text{Morality is a product of human culture and invention}.\\
  \text{Some sets of strong social rules are better than others}.\\
  \text{There is more than one good ethical tradition}.\\
  \text{There is no uniquely true morality}.
\end{align}
